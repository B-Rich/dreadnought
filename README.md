Dreadnought
===========

An automated aetherhunting system for the Mudlet MUD client, specifically for the game Lusternia.

Synopsis
--------

Dreadnought is a spiritual successor to the popular Windmills aetherhunting system, seeking to be as compatible as possible (while only breaking compatibility when necessary). As much as possible, Dreadnought tries to automate automate tasks in such a way as not to require someone calling out for commands.

Installing
----------

Download the latest Release ZIP file and install it through Mudlet's Package window. Unzip it, then navigate to the top-level of the repository. Zip up the included `Dreadnought` directory, then install that ZIP file through Mudlet's Package window.

Updating
--------

Unfortunately, because Mudlet doesn't make updating packages easy, you'll have to uninstall the previous version of Dreadnought before installing the updated version.

Documentation
-------------

Each of the four main aetherhunting roles has its own document detailing how to use the proper commands. You can find them within the [docs/](./docs/) directory within this repository.
