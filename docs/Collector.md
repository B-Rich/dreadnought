Collector
=========

The collector has the easiest set of commands to use: there's only one! The collector can be toggled between two modes: `Auto`, which will automatically siphon from a vortex should one appear in view; and `Call` which will siphon once for every time someone announced `"Siphon"` on the ship aether.

Commands
--------

- `smode <call|auto|off>` - Toggles the siphoning mode, or turns siphoning off completely.
