Combateer
=========

The combateer has two different modes: callout and auto, with the difference being how the system acquires targets. In callout mode, the Captain will automatically call out the target and the system will pick it up. Auto mode, on the other hand, will automatically acquire and fire upon targets.

Once you lock into the turret, the turretting mode is automatically set to `call`ing mode. See below for the exact commands to switch turretting modes.

It's important to note that the combateer system will automatically target karibideans when they arrive.

Commands
--------

- `tmode <call|auto|off>` - Toggles the current targetting mode, or turns targetting off completely.
- `ttar <target>` - Manually target an aetherbeast.
