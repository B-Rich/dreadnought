Empath
======

Much of the magic behind the empathing system takes place automatically, without any intervention needed from the user. However, the core functionality is still accessible through user commands.

Commands
--------

 - `gm` - Sends the `grid modules` command, which is set up to automatically assess the current damage done to each module.
 - `gr [reset]` - If for whatever reason the repairing process stops, this will restart it. Also, should you give the optional `reset` option, the repairing queue will be cleared.
 - `gsliv` - Will check for any slivven infecting the ship and announce their presence upon the ship's aether.
 - `gc` - Will clarity the command chair at the next available opportunity.
