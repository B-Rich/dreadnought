Empath
======

Much of the magic behind the empathing system takes place automatically, without any intervention needed from the user. However, the core functionality is still accessible through user commands.

Commands
--------

 - `gr [all|reset]` - By default, will check and repair any damaged modules as long as they're occupied by someone. Passing in the `all` parameter will repair all modules on the ship, regardless if they're occupied.
 - `gsliv` - Will check for any slivven infecting the ship and announce their presence upon the ship's aether.
 - `gc` - Will clarity the command chair at the next available opportunity.
 
 Crew Commands
 -------------
 
 If you're a crew-member, you can trigger the Empath to repair the entire ship by calling out `Repair` on the Ship Aether.
